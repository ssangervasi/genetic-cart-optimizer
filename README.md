genetic-cart-optimizer
======================

A genetic algorithm for optimizing a purchase of many items from many potential sellers, including a minimum purchase price from each seller. 

Originally prompted by an assigned project for Math 312: Applied Math for the Social Sciences, at Colgate University, April 2014. The project required a description and outline of a genetic algorithm. To put this description to the test, decided to write an implementation of the algorithm.

To run the program on the example data, execute the function testLargeData in evolve.py. By default this will run 10,000 generations, providing updates on the fitness of generations periodically.
